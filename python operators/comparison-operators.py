# PYTHON COMPARISON OPERATORS
# ****************************

#'  ==     ->     Equal to          ->   Returns True if both sides are equal
#'  !=     ->     Not equal to      ->   Returns True if both sides are not equal
#'  >      ->     Greater than      ->   Returns True if the left side is greater
#'  <      ->     Less than         ->   Returns True if the left side is less
#'  >=     ->     Greater than or equal to -> Returns True if the left side is greater or equal
#'  <=     ->     Less than or equal to    -> Returns True if the left side is less or equal




# PYTHON COMPARISON OPERATORS EXAMPLES
# *************************************

# EQUAL TO EXAMPLE
# -----------------
a = 10
b = 5
print("Equal To: a == b ->", a == b)  # False

# NOT EQUAL TO EXAMPLE
# ---------------------
a = 10
b = 5
print("Not Equal To: a != b ->", a != b)  # True

# GREATER THAN EXAMPLE
# ---------------------
a = 10
b = 5
print("Greater Than: a > b ->", a > b)  # True

# LESS THAN EXAMPLE
# ------------------
a = 10
b = 5
print("Less Than: a < b ->", a < b)  # False

# GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO EXAMPLE
# ---------------------------------
a = 10
b = 5
print("Greater Than or Equal To: a >= b ->", a >= b)  # True

# LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO EXAMPLE
# ------------------------------
a = 10
b = 10
print("Less Than or Equal To: a <= b ->", a <= b)  # True
